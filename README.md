A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

In our country because of the earthquakes so many people dies. One of the main reasons why these casualties is the people who were buried under the wreckage are not known where they were during the earthquake. Because of this situation search and rescue efforts end up failure. Our app sends your chosen person emergency message with location information while an earthquake occurs in your city.
